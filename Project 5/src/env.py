class GlobalEnv:
    """ Implements a "ribcage" data structure that stores bindings of variables and values as lists.

    Attributes:
        bindings (List): the identifiers
        values (List): the associated values bound to the variables
        prev (GlobalEnv): a reference to a previous GlobalEnv.

    Methods to implement:

    __init__  Initializes a new instance of a GlobalEnv.

        Args:
            prev (GlobalEnv): initialize the variables and values lists, the previous environment is initialized to the argument.



    empty_env A static method that returns the empty GlobalEnv.

        Args:

        Returns:
            GlobalEnv: A new instance of a GlobalEnv with None as the previous environment.

    lookup   Looks up the variable passed to it and returns the associated value.

        Args:
            symbol (string): A string that is a variable (identifier) that is bound to some value in an environment.

        Returns:
            value: The value that is bound to the symbol passed in. This can be any object that is stored in the
                values list associated with the symbol in a "rib" of the ribcage.

    extend  Creates a new "rib" in an environment.

        Args:
            bindings (List): a list of variable identifiers.
            values (List): a list of values that correspond to the identifiers in the variables list.
        Returns:
            GlobalEnv: A new instance of a GlobalEnv with "self" as the previous environment.

        have a reference to the global environment. It also does not need an empty_env method as all data
        required to create an instance will be known at that time.

        bindings (List): the identifiers
        values (List): the associated values bound to the variables
        prev (LocalEnv): a reference to a previous LocalEnv.
        globalenv (GlobalEnv): a reference to the GlobalEnv.

                lookup tries the global environment.

    extend  Creates a new "rib" in a local environment. Passes itself and its global env reference to constructor.

            bindings (List): a list of variable identifiers.
            values (List): a list of values that correspond to the identifiers in the variables list.
